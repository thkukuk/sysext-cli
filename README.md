# sysext-cli

`sysext-cli` is a command line utility to manage [systemd-sysext](https://manpages.opensuse.org/systemd-sysext) images on [openSUSE MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org).

## Directory Structure

Directories:
* `/var/lib/sysext-store` to store the sysext images
* `/etc/extensions` contains a symlink to the image

The reason for this is:

* Storing the images in `/var` means we can share them between snapshots
* Using symlinks in `/etc/extensions` means every snapshot:
  * will only see images fitting with this snapshot
  * rollback will also rollback the sysext images

## Workflows

For all downloads `systemd-pull` will be used, which is also able to verify the downloaded files.

### Import image

`sysext-cli` will differentiate two cases:

A full image name (including version and architecture) is specified:
* Download specific image to `/var/lib/sysext-store`.
* Create the symlink in `/etc/extensions`

Only the image name without version and architecture information are specified:
* Download the SHA256SUMs file from the remote repository.
* Check if there are matching image entries.
* Download the json files for this entries.
* Check if they are compatible with the OS.
* Download the image.
* Create symlink to `/etc/extionsions` in the running snapshot.

### Update image

`sysext-cli` will:
* Scan the local directory `/var/lib/sysext-store` for the existing images.
* Download the SHA256SUMs file from the remote repository.
* Check if there are newer versions for the installed images. If yes:
  * Download the `<image>.json` file.
  * Verify it machtes the OS version of the new snapshot.
  * Download the `<image>`.
  * Create symlink to `/etc/extionsions` inside the new snapshot

### Cleanup images

`sysext-cli` will:
* Check all snapshots for list of used images and remove the no longer needed ones.

## Dependency handling

The dependencies of sysext images are stored in a file inside of the image. To get the dependencies of an image you need to download and loopback mount it, which can end in a huge amount of data to download.

The solution is to provide a `<image>.json` file with the following structure:Â´, which contains all data:

```json
{
  "image_name": "strace-29.1.x86-64.raw",
  "sysext": {
    "ID": "opensuse-microos",
    "SYSEXT_LEVEL": "glibc-2.41",
    "VERSION_ID": "20250329",
    "SYSEXT_VERSION_ID": "29.1",
    "SYSEXT_SCOPE": "initrd system portable",
    "ARCHITECTURE": "x86-64"
  }
}
```
